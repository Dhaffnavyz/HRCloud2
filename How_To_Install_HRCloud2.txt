-----MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS-----
HRCloud2 requires at least a Raspberri Pi Model B+ or greater. 
HRCloud2 should run on any x86 or x64 based PC.
HRCloud2 requires a Debian Linux-based operating system w/3rd party audio license.

-----PREFACE-----
For this guide, it is assumed that the user is installing HRCloud2
on a PC which meets the above conditions. This guide will walk
a new user through the installation of HRCloud2 on a freshly installed
version of Lubuntu 16.04 LTS with no pre-existing dependencies. 

For a walkthrough of installing a Ubuntu distro, visit.....
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop

IMPORTANT NOTE: During this guide we will be setting-up a fully
functional, yet somewhat customized, LAMP stack including 
linux, Apache2.4, MySQL, and PHP7.0. If you DO NOT want to have
a LAMP stack installed on your local machine DO NOT install this software.
This software was designed to be run on a dedicated server setup for NAS
duties.

In the abscence of required dependencies, HRCloud2 will make every attempt 
to complete a user-suppied operation while logging errors every step of the way. 
Administrators are responsible for monitoring and maintaining the dependencies 
of their servers.

**SEARCH FOR AND MODIFY THE FOLLOWING VALUES CAREFULLY**
  max_execution_time = 90
  max_input_time = 90

-sudo apt install npm
-sudo apt-get install nodejs
-sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
-sudo apt-get install winetricks
-npm install nativefier -g
**REBOOT THE SERVER**
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 5 - INSTALL HRCLOUD2-----
**CREATE A DIRECTORY IN "/var/www/html" NAMED "HRProprietary"**
**CREATE ANOTHER DIRECTORY IN "/var/www/html/HRProprietary" NAMED "HRCloud2"**
**VISIT "http://github.com/zelon88/HRCloud2" AND DOWNLOAD THE LATEST HRCLOUD2 .zip FILE
  TO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER**
**EXTRACT HRCLOUD2.zip TO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER**
**COPY THE CONTENTS OF THE "HRCloud2-master" FOLDER TO "/var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRCloud2"*
-sudo leafpad /var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRCloud2/config.php
**CAREFULLY READ AND COMPLETELY FILL OUT THE CONFIG.PHP FILE!!!**
**HRCLOUD2 REQUIRES A SAFE LOCATION TO CREATE USER CLOUD DIRECTORIES. TO FACILITATE
  THIS YOU MUST CREATE A !!!NEW!!! DIRECTORY AND ENTER IS AS THE "$CloudLoc"**
**ONCE YOU HAVE CREATED A CLOUD LOCATION "$CloudLoc" CONTINUE**
          -sudo chmod -R 0755 /path/to/my/CloudLoc
          -sudo chown -R www-data /path/to/my/CloudLoc
          -sudo chgrp -R www-data /path/to/my/CloudLoc
**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALID "$CloudLoc" AND PROPER PERMISSIONS, HRCLOUD2 ...WILL...NOT...WORK!!!**
-sudo leafpad /var/www/html/HRProprietary/HRCloud2/Applications/HRAI/adminINFO.php
**CAREFULLY READ AND COMPLETELY FILL OUT YOUR ADMIN USER AND LOGIN INFO FOR HRAI**
-sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html
-sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/html
-sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/html
**OPTIONAL -sudo useradd -g www-data USERNAME  #adds your user to www-data usergroup.**
**MAKE SURE THAT ANY UPDATES YOU PERFORM TO HRCLOUD2 HAVE PROPER PERMISSIONS!!!**
**SCRUTINIZE / DOUBLE-CHECK THE PERMISSIONS FOR ANY FILES ADDED TO /HRCloud2 AFTER 
  INSTALLATION IS COMPLETE!!!**
**VISIT HTTP://localhost/HRProprietary/HRCloud2/index1.php IN A BROWSER TO HAVE HRCLOUD2 INSTALL WORDPRESS!!!**

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you need to correct permissions later, perform the following commands 
  from above again...
               -sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html
               -sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/html
               -sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/html
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 6 - CONFIGURE WORDPRESS-----
**NAVIGATE TO "/var/www/html"**
**EDIT "wp-config.php" WITH THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION**
  -define('DB_NAME', 'database1');
  -define('DB_USER', 'root');
  -define('DB_PASSWORD', 'YOURPASSWORD');
**VISIT "http://localhost" IN  A BROWSER AND YOU SHOULD BE GREETED BY THE WORDPRESS INSTALLATION PAGE**
**COMPLETELY READ AND FILL OUT THE WORDPRESS INSTALLATION PAGE**
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 7 - VISIT YOUR CLOUD!!!-----
Go to http://localhost/HRProprietary/HRCloud2 to view your Cloud Drive! The computer you install HRCloud2 onto
should be considered a staitionary NAS device that you can safely point your "Static NAT" at and access from anywhere. To accomplish
these things, follow the additional steps below. 
--------------------------------------------------

-----STEP 8 - ADD FIREWALL EXCEPTIONS AND SETUP STATIC NAT ON YOUR ROUTER-----
-According to the manual for the manufacturer of your broadband router, find the local IP address where you can make changes to it's
  configuration. Try entering "192.168.1.1" into a browser. If you are greeted with a login screen, check the bottom of your router or your
  system administrator for the required information. If you are not greeted with any tangible login screen other than an error message, 
  seek the owners manual for the specific make and manual for your router.
-Once you have gained access to your router, seek the settings which control Firewall exceptions and Static NAT settings.
  You should seek a way to enter the local IPv4 address of the machine running HRCloud2.
  You should also seek a way to enter a "Static NAT" entry for the local IPv4 address of the machine running HRCloud2.
  You should also forward port 80 to the internal IPv4 of the machine running HRCloud2.
  To configure SSL encryption, add port 443 to your port forwarding rules and visit www.letsencrypt.com for instructions on obtaining and installing an SSL certificate.
-It is not reccomended that you utilize this Cloud platform in commercial or even open-to-the-public fashion. 
-To protect your installation and your server, secure your administrator account within WordPress and disable account creation for visitors.
-If you want other users to have their own Cloud on your network, create an account for them manually by using the administrator features
  built into WordPress.
-HRCloud2 will create and maintain complete segregation of user Cloud files during operation, and will not impose restrictions on user uploads
  (however PHP will, so verify that your php.ini file is set correctly!!!).
-You and your users should now be able to access your server via any standard web browser by entering the IPv4 from your 
  ISP into the address bar. Alternatively you can purchase a domain name and point it at the IPv4 instead to obtain a ".com" 
  (or similar) address for your new Cloud.
