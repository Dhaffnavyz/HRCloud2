IDEAS 7/9/2018

-HRScan can be either PHP-AV with target towards the uploaded file with dropzone.
-HRDesktop-Scan can be a scanner in python based on PHP-AV and clamAV
-HRDesktop-Convert can be a converter in pythin based on HRConvert2 with as many dependencies as possible rolled up.
-On first click of HRAI it should expand.
-PHP-AV should make .html and .txt logfiles so that it can add a javascript script to auto scroll to bottom. Don't copy both in real-time, create the html first and update it and at the end when scan is done copy to .txt without the javascript and delete the .html original.
