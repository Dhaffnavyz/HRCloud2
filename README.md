# A Secure, Private Cloud Storage Platform for your Home Server!

HRCloud2 is a personal Cloud CMS Platform similar to ownCloud but with far greater capability that includes all the same functionality as a commercial end-user based Cloud platform. Functions like file conversion, OCR, archiving, dearchiving, A/V scanning, sharing and more. With HRCloud2 you can perform all your favorite bash and command line tools just by selecting checkboxes and clicking buttons, from anywhere. 

HRCloud2 can integrate with WordPress, although it will install what it needs from WordPress when it does not exist. It uses user accounts created by WordPress, but does not itself use a database for anything other than user authentication. All log and cache files are internally controlled. 

A perfect ownCloud or NextCloud alternative. 

# CURRENT CORE FEATURES
